# Customer-Segmentation-on-Online-Retail-Data-II

Project by: Rivana Christie and Pratik Dahibhate

As part of this project, we are using dimensionality reduction and clustering to segment the users from an online retail dataset. We use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Then we apply the following clustering techniques on the reduced dataset:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. K-Mean Mini Batch Clustering
3. Gaussian Mixture Model

Furthermore, we perform RFM segmentation on the dataset to segment the users based on their spending habits using the following clustering algorithms:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Spectral Clustering
3. Gaussian Mixture Model

## About the dataset
This Online Retail II data set contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
