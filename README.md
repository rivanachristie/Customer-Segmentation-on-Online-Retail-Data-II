# Customer-Segmentation-on-Online-Retail-Data-II

As part of this project, we are using dimensionality reduction and clustering to segment the users from an online retail dataset. We use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Then we apply the following clustering techniques on the reduced dataset:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. K-Mean Mini Batch Clustering
3. Gaussian Mixture Model

Furthermore, we perform RFM segmentation on the dataset to segment the users based on their spending habits using the following clustering algorithms:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Spectral Clustering
3. Gaussian Mixture Model
